From model building (often using cardboard cutouts), Watson realised that the A-T and C-G pairs are structurally similar. The Chargaff ratios, the structure of the base pairs held together by hydrogen bonds, the helical clues from X-ray crystallography all contributed to the insight that the structure is a double helix. Facing pairs on the inside of the helix match, A to T and C to G. The hydrogen bonds between them allow the helix to be unzipped for replication, and an exact copy is created."
